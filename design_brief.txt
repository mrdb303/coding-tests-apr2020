Building a fighting game (Part 3) - May 2020
============================================

In this challenge you will be starting the fight, processing the special powers and displaying the winner.

You can mix PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Frameworks are allowed however bonus points if you don't use frameworks

Please note that there is no health or strength cap however if the health is 0 the player should be removed from the game.

Level 1 - Pair up

    Randomly pair fighters together
    A creature can only have one opponent per fight.
    Create a column which holds the opponents name.

    There will be fighters who do not have an opponent due to an odd number of fighters
        If there is an odd number please ensure that the special powers are still processed

Level 2 - Distribute the special powers

    Randomly distribute the special powers across the creatures
    Only one special power is allowed per creature
    Display the special power in the 'Special Power' column

Level 3 - Process the special powers

    Adjust the HP, strength and remove creatures from the brawl where necessary
    Once the opponents have been paired randomly select which opponent uses their special power first
    Remove players who have a health of zero.

Example 1

A double 2 was rolled

Opponent A starts with a health of 200

Opponent B starts with a health of 250

    Opponent A = Increases health by 100
    Opponent B = Decreases their opponents health by 100

Result

    Opponent A having no change to health. It would still be 200

Example 2

A double 5 was rolled

    Opponent A = Decreases their strength between 1 - 100
    Opponent B = Hides (Skips a go)

Result

    Opponent A would have a reduction of health between 1 - 100
    The fight would not happen because opponent B is hidden

Example 3

A double 6 was rolled

    Opponent A = Steals 50% of the strength from opponent B
    Opponent B = Increases their strength between 1 - 100

Result

    Opponent B would gain an increase of strength between 1 - 100
    Opponent A would gain 50% of the Opponent B's health

Level 4 - Fight!

    After the special powers have been processed randomly decided which opponent will strike first
    Subtract the sum of the strength plus the dice roll from the opponents health
    If the opponents health has been reduced to zero then remove that opponent from the game
    Repeat for the second opponent

Level 5 - Display the winner!

    Keep rolling the dice until you get a winner
    Show that winner in the modal/alert

Level master

    Don't use any frameworks!



Additional Query
================

There are two scenarios where a special power could be issued and not used, which are:

    A creature is given a special power and is also deemed to be the odd numbered creature and is exempted from that round
    The creature is given a special power, but the opponent goes first and plays the special power of 'Hide'

Yep that's correct. If the player doesn't have an opponent then skip that players go and skip that players powers.
